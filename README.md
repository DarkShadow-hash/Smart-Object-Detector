# Smart Object Detector

## Two projects, one mission: From generic detection to personalized AI vision

### Visual Overview & Demonstration

This project implements a lightweight and highly accurate Computer Vision system, based on the YOLOv8 Nano architecture, specialized to detect three custom personal objects (Water Bottle, Headphones, Pencil Case) in real-time.

Core Goal: Demonstrate the effectiveness of Transfer Learning to specialize a generic model on a small, controlled dataset.

### Why Two Projects?
Project 1 Shows the Problem:
Generic detection that confuses objects

"Is that a phone or a chair?" 

But why ?
It's because it's limited to 80 pre-defined COCO classes.

Project 2 provides the solution:
Personalized AI trained to detect specifically YOUR objects

"That's definitely your iPhone with 95% confidence!" 

Recognizes anything you care about
